# se2wp
This script imports all articles from Social Engine to WordPress.
You can import categories and sub categories from social engine to wordpress, and it also insert all posts related to the category used in Social Engine. 
You must configure the database variables (I recommend to create a local database to build the SQL script).
All comments written on the source code are in spanish (sorry, it's my native language) 
So, feel free to modify by your self all the code as you need.

— The script is coded to build all the sentences on raw SQL into a "START TRANSACTION / COMMIT" lines. 
You can use this script as example if you have another database-engine. 


Happy lines.
